## AI Models

- **Gemini**: Google's latest model, great for creative apps
- **Qwen Coder**: Specialized coding model via OpenRouter
- **Mistral**: Fast and efficient for quick prototypes

## Tools Available to AI

- `create_file(file_path, content)` - Create new files
- `read_file(file_path)` - Read existing files
- `update_file(file_path, content)` - Modify files
- `list_files()` - Show all project files

## Development

```bash
# Development mode with auto-restart
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

## Examples

The AI can build:
- **Frontend Apps**: HTML/CSS/JS applications
- **Interactive Games**: Canvas-based games
- **Dashboards**: Data visualization apps
- **Utilities**: Calculators, converters, tools
- **Websites**: Multi-page sites with navigation

## Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Build a todo app with drag-and-drop" vs "Make an app"
2. **Iterate**: Ask for modifications after initial build
3. **Use Agent Mode**: Enable for autonomous building
4. **Check Preview**: Live preview updates automatically
5. **Edit Code**: Manual editing is supported alongside AI

## Troubleshooting

- **No Preview**: Make sure `index.html` exists
- **AI Errors**: Check API keys in `services/aiService.js`
- **Connection Issues**: Restart server and refresh browser
